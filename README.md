â€¢	Grocery for Good is a compassionate initiative designed to reduce food waste and support those in need by offering discounted groceries nearing their expiry dates to the army, handicapped individuals, and ashrams. By bridging the gap between surplus and scarcity, we aim to nourish the community and promote sustainability.
